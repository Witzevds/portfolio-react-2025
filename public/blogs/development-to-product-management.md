# From Development to Product Management

My career path hasn't followed a traditional trajectory. As I approach graduation, I'm intentionally transitioning from pure development work toward product management—a move that leverages my technical background while expanding into business strategy.

## Why the Transition?

After two years of hands-on development work with Drupal, React, and AI integration, I've discovered something important: **I love solving problems, but I'm most energized when those problems are at the intersection of technology and business.**

### What I Love About Development

- Building things from scratch
- Solving technical challenges
- Seeing code come to life
- Working with modern frameworks

### What I Love About Product

- Understanding user needs
- Strategic thinking
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Measuring impact

## The Plan

My transition strategy is deliberate and practical:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Continue developing technical expertise
- Take on projects that involve client interaction
- Learn product management fundamentals
- Build communication skills

### Phase 2: Hybrid Role (First 1-2 years post-graduation)
- Start as developer at Dropsolid
- Volunteer for product-adjacent tasks
- Shadow product managers
- Contribute to product decisions

### Phase 3: Product Owner
- Transition to Product Owner role
- Own feature roadmaps
- Work directly with stakeholders
- Bridge technical and business teams

### Phase 4: Product Manager
- Full product management responsibility
- Strategic planning and vision
- Market analysis and positioning
- Team leadership

## Skills I'm Building

The transition requires developing new competencies:

**Technical Foundation (Already Have)**
- Software development
- System architecture
- Technical problem-solving

**Business Skills (Developing)**
- Market analysis
- Business strategy
- Financial literacy
- Stakeholder management

**Soft Skills (Focus Area)**
- Communication and presentation
- Negotiation
- Leadership
- Emotional intelligence

## Why Dropsolid?

My upcoming role at Dropsolid is perfect for this transition because:

1. **Technical credibility**: I'll establish myself as a competent developer
2. **Client exposure**: Direct interaction with business stakeholders
3. **Growth path**: Clear trajectory toward product roles
4. **Company culture**: Values innovation and career development

## The Reality Check

I'm realistic about the challenges:

- Product management is highly competitive
- The transition takes time and patience
- I'll need to prove myself in both technical and business contexts
- Not every day will involve exciting strategy work

But I'm confident this is the right path. My technical background gives me credibility that many product managers lack, and my genuine interest in business strategy will drive continuous learning.

## Advice for Others

If you're considering a similar transition:

1. **Don't rush it**: Build strong technical fundamentals first
2. **Seek hybrid opportunities**: Look for roles that blend both worlds
3. **Learn the language**: Understand business metrics and KPIs
4. **Network strategically**: Connect with product managers and learn from them
5. **Stay technical**: Don't lose your development skills—they're your superpower
