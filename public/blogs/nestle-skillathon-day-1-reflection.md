# The Power of Marketing, Innovation & Entrepreneurship: Day 1

_A reflection on building culture brands in an era where being heard meaningfully has never been harder_

## The Paradigm Shift in Modern Marketing

Melanie Brinbaum opened the Nestlé Skillathon with a stark reality: it's never been harder to be heard in a meaningful way. The noise is deafening, and traditional marketing approaches are losing their effectiveness. What we're witnessing is a fundamental transformation in how brands connect with their audiences.

The old playbook of marketing to consumers, running campaigns that drive awareness, and competing for attention is dying. In its place, a new approach is emerging—one that focuses on building culture brands with people, co-creating with communities, creating acts that foster belonging, earning meaning rather than buying attention, and measuring impact through resonance and participation rather than mere reach.

> **Your thoughts:** How have you noticed this change in your own consumer behavior? Do you feel more connected to brands that involve you in their story?

## The Three Pillars of Culture Brands

Culture brands exist at the intersection of three critical elements:

- **Purpose** – Your brand needs to be relevant, but authenticity is non-negotiable. Purpose isn't about jumping on every trending cause—it's about staying true to your brand's core values while making them meaningful in today's context.
- **People** – Consumers spend significant time reading reviews and ratings. They're doing their homework, and they expect brands to do the same. Understanding what people truly need and want goes beyond demographics and data points.
- **Participation** – This means genuine social engagement, and yes, that includes reading the negative comments even when it's uncomfortable. Participation is where meaning is created, where communities form, and where brand loyalty is earned rather than bought.

## The New Marketing Fundamentals

1. **Be Brave, Be True**  
   If you're not brave, you're not unique. In a world of copycats and safe choices, bravery is what cuts through the noise. This doesn't mean being controversial for controversy's sake—it means having the courage to be unmistakably you, even when that means no generic branding or product shots.
2. **Think Like a Challenger**  
   Even if you're a market leader, adopt the mindset of a challenger. You have to think like an entrepreneur. Question everything. Don't accept "that's how it's always been done" as a valid answer.
3. **Outsmart vs. Outspend**  
   Limited budget? Good. Constraints breed creativity. Dare to go in a different direction than your competitors. Some of the most memorable marketing moments came from brands that couldn't outspend the competition, so they outsmarted them instead.
4. **Listen to What People Really Mean**  
   Creators and influencers understand relevance in ways that traditional marketers often miss. When they genuinely love a brand, they want to participate and co-create. The key is listening carefully to what's being said—and what's not being said—beneath the surface.
5. **Add Value to Your Customers**  
   Lisa Humphreys emphasized that when you truly add value and invite people to collaborate, participation naturally grows. Take Nike's approach of showcasing new shoes through street art and graffiti—it's about focusing on people, brand, and participation. Get people moving, both literally and figuratively.

## The Skills That Matter

### Hard Skills
- Digital Literacy – Non-negotiable in today's landscape
- Data Analysis & Interpretation – Understanding the story behind the numbers
- Agile Project Management – Map your goals, iterate constantly, and don't be afraid to pivot
- Understanding AI – But remember: AI struggles with the illogical, and sometimes that's exactly what people need

### Soft Skills (The Real Differentiators)
- Creative Problem Solving – See challenges as opportunities
- Cultural Curiosity – Stay hungry to understand the world around you
- Adaptability and Resilience – Change is the only constant
- Collaboration and Teamwork – No one builds great brands alone
- Storytelling – Give people a sense of presence and interaction; be authentic and trust your gut

## The Power of Going Deeper

Here's what struck me most from the session: Don't just stick to facts. Have conversations. Go to your customers' homes. Ask questions, observe—really understand what the people expect from your brand.

We're not vocal enough in marketing. We see things but don't speak up. Don't be scared to share new ideas with your team. Remember, people scroll the equivalent length of the Empire State Building on their phones—you have to hook them instantly.

## Trust Your Gut (It's Backed by Science)

Perhaps the most liberating insight: you already have gut feeling—you don't need to develop it. Ninety-five percent of decisions are emotional, not rational. So collect the best ads you've seen, examine what emotions they evoke, and discuss them with your team. Train your emotional intelligence. Get to know your feelings and use them as a tool.

AI can help you consume and process vast amounts of data quickly, and interactions with AI can help you deliver knowledge to consumers more easily. But at the end of the day, the most powerful tool in your marketing arsenal is still very human: empathy.

## The Ecosystem Approach

The three winning strategies that emerged from the Skillathon reinforce each other:

1. **Be unmistakably you** – No generic branding, no safe product shots
2. **Think like a challenger** – Even when you're not one
3. **Add value and build an ecosystem** – Your consumers will join you when you give them something worth participating in

## Final Thoughts

Keep empathy at the center of everything you do. Be humble. When you approach people with genuine curiosity and humility, they'll give you ideas and feedback that no amount of market research could uncover.

The future of marketing isn't about shouting louder—it's about meaning more. It's about building culture brands that people want to participate in, not just purchase from.
