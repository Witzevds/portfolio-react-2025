# Nestlé Skillathon Experience

My journey at the Nestlé Skillathon event was an incredible learning experience that pushed me to think creatively and work collaboratively with talented individuals from diverse backgrounds.

## The Challenge

The Skillathon presented us with a real-world business challenge: how to leverage AI and digital innovation to improve sustainability in the food industry. Our team had 48 hours to develop a comprehensive solution.

## What I Learned

### Collaboration is Key

Working with professionals from different disciplines taught me the importance of:

- **Communication**: Clear articulation of technical concepts to non-technical team members
- **Flexibility**: Adapting to different working styles and perspectives
- **Innovation**: Combining diverse expertise to create unique solutions

### AI in Action

I had the opportunity to demonstrate how AI can be practically applied to solve business problems. We built a prototype that:

1. Analyzed supply chain data
2. Predicted sustainability metrics
3. Provided actionable recommendations

## The Outcome

Our team's presentation was well-received, and I made valuable connections with industry leaders. The experience reinforced my passion for bridging the gap between technical development and business strategy.

## Key Takeaways
