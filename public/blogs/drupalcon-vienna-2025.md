# DrupalCon Vienna 2025 Highlights

Attending DrupalCon Vienna 2025 was a milestone moment in my career. Having my Figma-to-Drupal AI workflow featured during Dries Buytaert's keynote was an incredible honor.

## The Journey

What started as an internship project at Calibrate turned into something that caught the attention of the Drupal founder himself. The journey from initial rejection to keynote feature taught me invaluable lessons about persistence and innovation.

## The Keynote Moment

Watching Dries present my work on the main stage was surreal. The workflow I developed addresses a real pain point in the Drupal ecosystem:

- **Problem**: Manual conversion of design files to Drupal components is time-consuming
- **Solution**: AI-powered automation that maintains design fidelity
- **Impact**: Reduces development time by up to 70%

## Networking and Connections

DrupalCon isn't just about sessions—it's about the people. I had the opportunity to:

- Meet with industry leaders and potential employers
- Receive personal messages from Dries about future presentations
- Connect with developers from around the world
- Discuss potential collaborations with agencies

## Technical Insights

The conference showcased cutting-edge developments in:

1. **AI Integration**: Multiple sessions on leveraging AI in CMS development
2. **Performance**: New approaches to Drupal optimization
3. **Accessibility**: Best practices for inclusive web development

## Career Impact

This experience has significantly elevated my profile in the Drupal community. The exposure has led to:

- Featured profiles in industry publications like The Drop Times
- Interview requests from major Drupal agencies
- Speaking opportunities at future events

## Looking Forward

The relationships and recognition gained at DrupalCon have opened doors I never imagined. I'm excited to continue contributing to the Drupal ecosystem while transitioning toward product management.
