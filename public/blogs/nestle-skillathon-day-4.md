# Day 4: Green Skills and Why Saving the Planet Is Actually a Job

_Climate change, regenerative agriculture, and why the best sustainability careers don't have "sustainability" in the title_

## The 12% Problem

Belén Montoya Sanchos opened with a stat that should worry all of us: Only 12% of farmers in Europe are younger than 40 years old.

Think about that. The people growing our food are aging out, and young people aren't replacing them. This isn't just a farming problem—it's a generational renewal crisis.

Simon Bigles, a Swiss farmer, put it simply: "We have so much time left. Now is the time to take things seriously. We need it for generations, not just for tomorrow."

But here's the thing that struck me most about Day 4: Sustainability isn't one job. It's not even one career path. It's a mindset, a skill set, and increasingly, it's woven into almost every role you can imagine.

## What Does Sustainability Actually Mean?

Before we dive in, let's get clear on what we're even talking about.

For Simon: Sustainability is searching and finding long-term solutions that go through one generation, or even more—not just short-term fixes.

For Belén: It's about caring for people and for the future. She loves nature, respect, humbleness. Always stay connected to what truly matters.

These aren't corporate definitions. They're human ones. And that matters.

## A Farmer's Take on Regenerative Agriculture

Simon grew up as a farmer. His father made him fall in love with farming. He never could imagine doing anything else.

So what does his farm actually DO for sustainability?

- **Biogas plant:** Simon uses all the organic waste to feed a biogas plant. This generates green energy, which he shares with the local community.
- **Healthy soil:** You have to work with the soil and give back. It doesn't work when you only take from the soil—you have to give back. (Honestly, this is just like life, isn't it?)
- After the biogas process, they bring the rest back to the soil. They've been doing this for about 10 years.
- Simon involves young people. Every year, 200-300 students come to the farm to learn.

## Nestlé's Three-Level Strategy for Training the New Generation

Belén broke down how Nestlé approaches sustainability training:

1. **Technical Support**
   - Practices and solutions toolbox. Using technical things like drones or new systems for sustainable farming.
2. **Financing the Transition**
   - Co-financing with banks, insurance companies, etc.
3. **Collaboration**
   - Working with others to build understanding of what regenerative agriculture actually is. Try to get customers to want food that's been made from regenerative agriculture.

Because here's the truth: Farmers can't do this alone. They need financial support. They need technical tools. And they need consumers who care.

## The Most Critical Skills for Regenerative Agriculture

Simon's answer surprised me:

- **Patience.** To understand that when you want to change something, it takes years before you see real progress.
- **Courage.** To change something. Think outside the box.

The goal isn't perfection—it's good quality across everything at the farm.

And yes, more people are starting to care. When the young farmer takes over, they can implement their ideas and make the right steps.

"I think we are in a good way," Simon said.

## The Money Problem (That Nobody Wants to Talk About)

Simon got real about something that often gets glossed over:

> "We need sustainable prices that we can afford a living on this job. And that we see a future."

In the end, a sustainable and fair price is a basic need. Farmers are people who work. People who have families. They want to see a green number at the end.

Farming needs to be profitable. If not, it has no future.

This matters because all the passion and idealism in the world doesn't pay the bills. Sustainability has to be economically viable, or it won't scale.

## What You Can Actually Do

Belén had a surprisingly simple call to action:

- Go in the supermarket and watch the products. Look at what you can do with it. Don't throw it away. Eat it.

Farmers try so hard to make it sustainable, and then it just goes to waste for nothing. All the hard work, gone.

Stay true to yourself. But also recognize that every purchasing decision is a vote for the kind of world you want.

## The Big Picture: Regenerative Agriculture

Here's what it actually includes:
- Diverse cropping systems & livestock integration
- Collective & landscape actions
- Soil health
- Biodiversity
- Water security & quality

It's not just about "going organic." It's a complete system redesign.

## How Nestlé Changed to Hit 2030 Targets

Someone asked Belén: How did your day-to-day have to change to work toward the target of lowering emissions by 50% by 2030?

Her answer: Stay connected to what truly matters. Where can we make the biggest impact? Where do we need to focus and prioritize?

Rally and influence internally and externally to make that change.

You can't do things everywhere. Try new things, but try them in places where you want to make a difference.

For Nestlé in Europe, that means focusing on:
- Dairy (because of the footprint in their products)
- Cereals
- Vegetables

They decided to focus on those and start working with farmers in the regions where they're sourcing those materials to implement regenerative agriculture.

## Can AI Help Save the Planet (Even Though It Uses So Much Energy)?

This question came up, and I thought it was brilliant:

> "Do you think AI and data analytics can help make farming better for the planet, even though AI uses a lot of energy and is known to pollute?"

Belén's answer: Let's have more biodigesters involved and implemented in dairy farms, so we can create sustainable energy that can be used for the amount of energy needed for AI.

Because AI is here to stay. And it creates an opportunity to do things faster and introduce technology into farming.

Simon agreed: "AI will be a big part of the future. We have a lot of data on the farm."

They have milking robots that milk the cows. Feeding robots that distribute food. It would be a shame not to use all that data to make good decisions.

The key isn't rejecting technology—it's using it intelligently and powering it sustainably.

## The Ocean Is in Dramatic Decline (And Here's What One Company Is Doing About It)

Wietse van der Werf introduced us to the Sea Rangers program, and honestly, this might be one of the coolest things I've heard all week.

The problem: For the last 300 years, we've seen the ocean as something we only take from. There have been protected areas, fisheries are banned or regulated, but that's passive protection.

The solution: We need people to actively restore oceans. And we need to give them jobs to do so.

That's where Sea Rangers comes in—a social enterprise that trains young people to actively restore oceans and gives them jobs doing it.

## What Is a Sea Ranger?

It's an entry-level training program to start working in ocean jobs. While Sea Rangers are with the program, they do all types of assignments—nature restoration, data collection, field work.

Here's what's radical: You don't need to be an expert. You don't need to have studied ocean science.

They're looking for:
- Motivation
- Ability to work as part of a team
- Good communication
- Grit and determination when things get tough

They're pushing the boundaries of young people to see if they have it in them.

## The Work Is Real (And Hard)

Sea Rangers operate on special ships—big sailing ships. There's a lot of training involved.

They collect data. They validate satellite data by measuring in the field. It's a full-time ranger service—8 months to a year.

After that, they connect you with other employers. You don't need experience going in. They train you.

So far, they've had 208 young people as rangers.

## A Day in the Life

They had a Sea Ranger join the call—Elise—and she described what it's actually like:

> "We work by the moon, not 9-5."

Double tides. Depends on what they're doing—transplanting seagrass, heavy crates, lots of mud. It involves the whole cycle of seagrass: the right stage of seeds, quality, quantity.

Most of the time when the sea is gone, they work in the mud. Sometimes with snorkels. And then there's cooking.

What she learned:
- How to trust herself
- Teamwork and team building (important soft skills)
- Technical skills in maritime conservation
- Her body can do more than she thought
- A lot of personal development

It's cozy on the ship, but not a place where you can be alone. It's all in one space.

And that tells you so much about the kind of person they are and their character. They can probably be trained in lots of different fields or skills.

## The Takeaway That Matters

Wietse said something that applies way beyond ocean conservation:

> "Don't blind stare on just qualification and job position. Think about what life skills you can bring in. Because employers—if they can see you have the potential to be developed and coached—that goes really, really far."

## Job Market Anxiety and Real Advice

Someone asked about anxiety around finding work in sustainability. What tips do you have?

Wietse's answer:

> "Don't give up." There's a lot of no's. There can be a lot of rejections. Applying for a job IS a job in itself.

And here's a key insight: If you want to work in a sustainable job, most of the places where they need it most won't necessarily offer a title saying "sustainable manager."

Look beyond the title. Look at what the organization is actually doing.

## Representation Matters

Kerstin Schmied from Purina chimed in with something important:

> "You can only want to be what you can see."

Having that representation—seeing other people in the role—those role models are super important.

It's up to employers to create safe working environments and accessible training to make sure people can enter those career steps.

And career paths aren't linear. Kerstin's colleague Lisa came from IT and now runs an ocean regeneration program. Kerstin herself is a lawyer by training, worked in HR, did corporate communication and marketing, and then sustainability came through the public affairs angle.

"After 20 years, I'm eventually where I should be. All these pieces come together."

The skills you learn in one field are invaluable in the next.

## Sustainability Isn't One Job

This was the recurring theme throughout the entire session:

Sustainability is not one single job. It's a combination of skill sets and where you're driven with your passion.

Kerstin broke it down using a BBC campaign they did:

You need people who can:
- Define the concept - What do you want to communicate?
- Write creatively - Tell the story in 30 seconds so it comes across
- Edit - They use AI for this too
- Handle PR and influencer campaigns
- Navigate legal and regulatory - Everything you say must be substantiated. No greenwashing. Can you prove what you're saying is correct?
- Execute marketing - Bring the message to the audience

In every part, there's a role where you can bring your skill set to life.

## The Path Isn't Linear (And That's Okay)

Kerstin's final message was one of reassurance:

> "Trust a little bit that the path is not always linear. Sometimes you do a few curves."

Sometimes certain skill sets will help you even if your next step isn't the most obvious. It builds skills that contribute to the next one.

It's not only one person doing the job—it's usually a team. All those partners bringing the vision to life together.

You need all these different perspectives and skills.

## What I'm Taking Away from Day 4

- ✅ Sustainability careers don't always have "sustainability" in the title
- ✅ Soft skills matter as much as technical skills
- ✅ Your career path will be messy, and that's fine
- ✅ Patience is a critical skill
- ✅ Profitability and sustainability must go together
- ✅ You don't need a master's degree to start
- ✅ Every purchasing decision is a vote

## The Bottom Line

Day 4 reminded me that saving the planet isn't abstract. It's farmers working with soil. It's young people transplanting seagrass in the mud. It's lawyers and IT professionals pivoting into sustainability roles. It's gamers realizing their skills can help regenerate oceans.

The climate crisis feels overwhelming because it IS overwhelming. But the solutions aren't just policy and technology—they're people. Young people with motivation. People willing to learn. People who stay connected to what truly matters.

Sustainability is about people, not data alone. We need to change the way people think.

And if you're wondering where you fit in? The answer is probably somewhere you haven't looked yet. Your gaming skills might save coral reefs. Your communication skills might change how people buy food. Your willingness to get muddy and work on a ship might restore an entire ecosystem.

The opportunities are there. And they're more accessible than you think.
