# Day 4: Green Skills and Why Saving the Planet Is Actually a Job

*Climate change, regenerative agriculture, and the careers you didn't know existed*

**Read time: 5 minutes**

## The 12% Problem

Belén Montoya Sanchos opened with a stat that should worry everyone:

**Only 12% of farmers in Europe are younger than 40 years old.**

Think about that. The people growing our food are aging out, and young people aren't replacing them.

This isn't just a farming problem. It's a generational crisis.

Simon Bigles, a Swiss farmer, put it simply: **"Now is the time to take things seriously. We need it for generations, not just for tomorrow."**

But here's what struck me most about Day 4: Sustainability isn't one job. It's not even one career path. It's a mindset woven into almost every role you can imagine.

## What Does Sustainability Actually Mean?

**For Simon:** Finding long-term solutions that last generations—not just short-term fixes.

**For Belén:** Caring for people and the future. Nature, respect, humbleness. Staying connected to what truly matters.

These aren't corporate definitions. They're human ones. And that matters.

## A Farmer's Take on the Real Work

Simon grew up farming. His father made him fall in love with it. He never imagined doing anything else.

So what does his farm actually do?

**Biogas plant:** All organic waste feeds a biogas plant. This generates green energy shared with the local community.

**Healthy soil:** You have to give back to the soil. It doesn't work if you only take. (Honestly, that's just like life, isn't it?)

After the biogas process, they return nutrients to the soil. They've been doing this for 10 years.

And here's the cool part: Every year, 200-300 students come to learn.

## How Nestlé Trains the Next Generation

Belén broke down their three-level approach:

**1. Technical Support**  
Drones, new systems, solutions toolbox for sustainable farming.

**2. Financing the Transition**  
Co-financing with banks, insurance companies.

**3. Collaboration**  
Working with others to build understanding. Getting customers to actually want food made from regenerative agriculture.

Because farmers can't do this alone. They need financial support, technical tools, and consumers who care.

---

## The Skills That Actually Matter

Simon's answer surprised me:

**Patience.** Change takes years before you see real progress.

**Courage.** To change something. Think outside the box.

The goal isn't perfection—it's good quality across everything.

And yes, more people are starting to care. When young farmers take over, they implement new ideas.

"I think we are in a good way," Simon said.

---

## The Money Problem Nobody Talks About

Simon got real about something often glossed over:

**"We need sustainable prices we can afford to live on. And that we see a future."**

Farmers are people who work. People with families. They want to see profit.

**Farming needs to be profitable. If not, it has no future.**

This matters because passion doesn't pay bills. Sustainability has to be economically viable, or it won't scale.

---

## What You Can Actually Do

Belén's call to action was surprisingly simple:

**Go to the supermarket. Look at the products. Don't throw food away. Eat it.**

Farmers work so hard to make it sustainable, and then it goes to waste. All that hard work, gone.

Every purchasing decision is a vote for the world you want.

---

## The Big Picture

Regenerative agriculture includes:

- Diverse cropping systems and livestock integration
- Collective landscape actions
- Soil health
- Biodiversity
- Water security and quality

It's not just "going organic." It's complete system redesign.

---

## How Nestlé Hit Their Targets

Someone asked Belén: How did your day-to-day change to lower emissions 50% by 2030?

Her answer: **Stay connected to what truly matters. Where can we make the biggest impact?**

You can't do everything everywhere. Try new things where you want to make a difference.

For Nestlé in Europe, that means:
- Dairy (huge footprint)
- Cereals
- Vegetables

They work with farmers in those regions to implement regenerative agriculture.

## Can AI Save the Planet?

This question was brilliant:

"Can AI help farming even though AI uses so much energy?"

Belén's answer: **Let's create more biodigesters in dairy farms to generate sustainable energy for AI.**

AI is here to stay. It's an opportunity to work faster and introduce smart technology.

Simon agreed: "We have milking robots, feeding robots. We have tons of data. It would be a shame not to use it."

The key isn't rejecting technology—it's using it intelligently and powering it sustainably.

## The Ocean Crisis (And an Unexpected Solution)

Wietse van der Werf introduced Sea Rangers, and honestly, this might be the coolest thing all week.

**The problem:** For 300 years, we've only taken from the ocean. Protected areas help, but that's passive.

**The solution:** Train young people to actively restore oceans. And give them jobs doing it.

Sea Rangers is a social enterprise doing exactly that.

---

## What Is a Sea Ranger?

It's an entry-level program for ocean jobs. Rangers do nature restoration, data collection, field work.

Here's what's radical: **You don't need experience. You don't need a degree in ocean science.**

They're looking for:
- Motivation
- Teamwork
- Communication
- Grit when things get tough

They push boundaries to see if you have it in you.

---

## The Work Is Real and Hard

Sea Rangers operate on big sailing ships. Lots of training involved.

They collect data. Validate satellite data in the field. It's 8 months to a year full-time.

After that, they connect you with other employers.

So far: 208 young people as rangers.

## A Day in the Life

Elise, a Sea Ranger, described it:

**"We work by the moon, not 9-5."**

Double tides. Transplanting seagrass, heavy crates, lots of mud. The whole seagrass cycle—seeds, quality, quantity.

When the sea is gone, they work in mud. Sometimes with snorkels. Then cooking.

What she learned:
- How to trust herself
- Teamwork and team building
- Technical maritime conservation skills
- Her body can do more than she thought
- A lot of personal development

It's cozy on the ship but not private. All in one space.

And that tells you about character. These people can probably be trained in lots of fields.

## The Key Insight

Wietse said something that applies beyond ocean work:

**"Don't focus only on qualifications and job titles. Think about what life skills you bring. Employers who see potential to develop and coach you—that goes really far."**

---

## Real Advice for Job Market Anxiety

Someone asked about finding sustainability work.

Wietse's answer:

**"Don't give up."**

Lots of no's. Lots of rejections. Applying for jobs IS a job.

Key insight: **Most places that need sustainability work won't have "sustainable manager" in the title.**

Look beyond titles. Look at what the organization actually does.

## Representation Matters

Kerstin from Purina said something important:

**"You can only want to be what you can see."**

Role models matter. Seeing others in the role is crucial.

And career paths aren't linear. Her colleague Lisa came from IT and now runs ocean regeneration. Kerstin herself: lawyer, HR, corporate communication, marketing, then sustainability through public affairs.

"After 20 years, I'm where I should be. All these pieces came together."

Skills from one field become invaluable in the next.

---

## Sustainability Isn't One Job

This was the recurring theme:

**Sustainability is a combination of skill sets and passion.**

Kerstin broke down a BBC campaign they did. You need people who can:

- Define the concept
- Write creatively (tell the story in 30 seconds)
- Edit (using AI too)
- Handle PR and influencer campaigns
- Navigate legal and regulatory (no greenwashing)
- Execute marketing

In every part, there's a role for your skills.

---

## The Path Isn't Linear

Kerstin's final message:

**"Trust that the path isn't always linear. Sometimes you take curves."**

Skills from one step help with the next, even if it's not obvious.

It's not one person doing the job—it's a team. Different perspectives and skills bringing the vision to life.

---

## What I'm Taking Away

**Sustainability careers don't have "sustainability" in the title**  
Look at what organizations actually do.

**Soft skills matter as much as technical**  
Motivation, teamwork, grit open doors.

**Career paths are messy**  
Every experience builds skills for the next thing.

**Patience is critical**  
Real change takes years. Get comfortable with the long game.

**Profitability and sustainability go together**  
Idealism doesn't pay bills. Solutions need to be economically viable.

**You don't need a master's to start**  
Sea Rangers proves you can learn on the job with the right attitude.

**Every purchase is a vote**  
Don't waste sustainable food. Choices matter.

---

## The Bottom Line

Day 4 reminded me: saving the planet isn't abstract.

It's farmers working with soil. Young people transplanting seagrass in mud. Lawyers and IT professionals pivoting to sustainability. Gamers realizing their skills can regenerate oceans.

The climate crisis is overwhelming. But solutions aren't just policy and technology—they're people.

Young people with motivation. People willing to learn. People who stay connected to what matters.

**Sustainability is about people, not data alone. We need to change how people think.**

Where do you fit in? Probably somewhere you haven't looked yet.

Your gaming skills might save coral reefs. Your communication skills might change how people buy food. Your willingness to get muddy might restore an ecosystem.

**The opportunities are there. And they're more accessible than you think.**
