# Day 2: AI Won't Steal Your Job (But Someone Using AI Might)

_Digital Innovation, Data Strategy, and Why Being Human Still Matters at Nestlé_

## Let's Talk About the Elephant in the Room

Everyone's freaking out about AI, right? "Will it take my job?" "Should I learn to code?" "Am I going to be obsolete?"

Mattia, one of Nestlé's leaders, cut through all that noise with something that actually made sense: AI will enhance human roles, not completely replace them. The human touch remains essential.

But here's the thing—and this is what the whole day was really about—you can't just stick your head in the sand and pretend technology isn't changing everything. You need to understand it, work WITH it, and use it to amplify what makes you uniquely human.

Let's break down what I learned on Day 2 of the Nestlé Skillathon.

## What Actually Makes You Innovative?

Mattia laid out something that sounds simple but is actually pretty profound. Innovation requires three things working together:

- **Curiosity & Rigor**: You need to be curious enough to ask questions, but rigorous enough to actually follow through and find answers.
- **Speed & Scale**: Moving fast is great, but if you can't scale it, what's the point?
- **Pioneering Spirit with Discipline**: Be bold, but don't be reckless. Dream big, but execute smartly.

And then he said something that hit me: "Challenge yourself at a young age to make things happen—this creates differentiation."

Not "wait until you're senior." Not "learn everything first." Just... start making things happen. Now.

The people who stand out aren't necessarily the smartest or most experienced. They're the ones who actually DO stuff.

## Inside Nestlé's Data Machine

Jessica Matheron, Nestlé's Chief Data Officer, gave us a peek behind the curtain of how a massive company actually handles data. And honestly? It's not as sexy as you'd think, but it's fascinating.

Her team's job boils down to three things:

1. Make data reliable, consistent, and accessible  
   (Boring but essential—garbage in, garbage out)
2. Ensure compliance and security  
   (Even more boring but even MORE essential)
3. Transform data into actionable insights  
   (This is where it gets interesting—dashboards, alerts, models that actually help people make decisions)

But here's my favorite thing she said, and honestly it should be on a poster:

> "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."

That's it. That's the whole philosophy of working in big organizations. Solo genius gets you quick wins. Teams get you lasting impact.

## Three People, Three Very Different Data Jobs

What I loved about this session was meeting three people doing completely different things with data, and realizing how varied these careers actually are.

**Mathieu: The Coordinator**  
He's the Consumer Data Deployment Lead, which sounds corporate and boring until you realize he's coordinating 100 stakeholders and managing budgets while trying to keep everyone aligned.

His superpower? Having both technical background AND business acumen. He's the bridge between the nerds building the tech and the business people who need to understand why it matters.

Key takeaway: You don't need to be the best coder or the best business person. Being good at BOTH makes you incredibly valuable.

**Tarik: The Data Engineer**  
Tarik's journey is honestly inspiring. He went from being a "shy technician" to a confident professional. How? By realizing that scale matters.

Building something for one country is completely different from building for multiple countries. Once he understood that, everything clicked.

His job? Collecting, organizing, and cleaning data. Sounds unglamorous, but without people like Tarik, nothing else works.

**Achille: The Data Scientist**  
This guy is doing some genuinely cool stuff. He's building "consumer embeddings"—basically teaching AI to understand what you might want across ALL of Nestlé's products.

The goal? Recommend the right product at the right time based on what you actually care about—health, pleasure, sustainability, whatever matters to you.

His vision: "Create consumer journey predictions similar to how LLMs predict next words."

That's... actually really smart. And a little bit creepy. But mostly smart.

## The Real Talk About AI and Your Career

The Q&A session got into the stuff people actually want to know:

**Do I need to learn to code?**  
Not necessarily. Even non-technical roles benefit from understanding technical language, but coordination roles need strong people management more than coding skills.

Learning basic technology helps you communicate better. You don't need to build the thing—you just need to understand what's possible and what's not.

**Will AI replace my intuition?**  
Here's where it gets interesting:

- AI discovers new insights and trends in data that humans might miss
- Humans are still needed to ask the right questions and provide business context
- The best approach: Start with data insights, then apply human judgment

It's not AI OR humans. It's AI AND humans working together.

**Should I just use AI for everything?**  
NO. And they had a great analogy for this:

> "AI is like a hammer—understand your problem first, then use the tool."

Don't throw AI at problems without understanding the business gap first. Generic tools like ChatGPT, Nest GPT, and Copilot are great for emails, coding help, and content creation. But you still need to know WHAT you're trying to solve.

## Carola from Microsoft: Productivity Isn't What You Think

Carola Ingegnieros from Microsoft came in and basically told us we've been thinking about productivity all wrong.

**The Old Way:**  
Productivity = Efficiency, input-output, doing more, quantitative metrics

**The New Way:**  
Productivity = Increasing creativity, amplifying impact, sparking innovation, being intentional and focused, doing what matters, not just doing more

The key insight that changed how I think about AI:

> Build WITH AI, not be replaced BY AI.

## 10 Productivity Tips That Actually Work

Carola didn't just philosophize—she gave us 10 concrete things to do. Here are the ones that stuck with me:

1. **Destroy Procrastination**  
   The 2-minute rule: If you see a task, do it immediately, schedule it, or delete it. Stop letting things pile up in mental limbo.
2. **Eat Your Frog**  
   Tackle your hardest task first thing every day. Once that's done, everything else feels easier.
3. **Batch Boring Stuff**  
   Group repetitive tasks together to avoid context switching. Answer all your emails at once. Make all your calls in one block. Your brain will thank you.
4. **Time Box Thinking**  
   Turn endless work into focused sprints. "I'll work on this for 45 minutes" is way better than "I'll work on this until it's done."
5. **Parking Lot**  
   Write down distracting ideas as they come, then review them monthly. Don't let random thoughts derail your focus.
6. **Smart Delegate**  
   When you delegate, provide ALL the context, deadlines, and links upfront. Don't make people guess what you need.
7. **Smart Inbox**  
   Use rules to auto-sort emails. Keep your inbox focused on what actually matters.
8. **Smart Invites**  
   Include multiple time slots, clear purpose, and an agenda. Respect people's time.
9. **Smart Prompts**  
   Use AI for first drafts, then refine and personalize. Don't just copy-paste what ChatGPT spits out.
10. **Protect Your Energy**  
    Not just your time. Resting IS productivity.

This last one is huge. We're so obsessed with optimization that we forget our brains need downtime to actually process and create.

## How to Actually Use AI Well

Carola broke down the anatomy of a good AI prompt, and honestly, most people are doing this wrong:

1. Goals - What do you want to achieve?
2. Context - Who is it for? What tone should it have?
3. Sources - Ground your request in specific documents
4. Expectations - Specify format, length, keywords

And the most important part: Always review and revise AI outputs.

AI gives you a starting point, not a finished product. If you're just copy-pasting AI responses, you're doing it wrong.

## Some Perspectives That Made Me Think

**On AI dependency:**
> "We should drive AI's behavior, not let AI drive ours."

This is so important. AI is a tool. You're still the one making decisions.

**On sustainability:**
Microsoft is committed to sustainable data centers. Do more, but at a sustainable pace. Burnout doesn't help anyone.

**On routine:**
Don't aim for complete control—embrace dynamic changes. The quest for the "perfect routine" is exhausting. Just roll with it.

**For neurodivergent individuals:**
Turn off notifications. Use tools that work for YOUR needs. There's no one "right" way to be productive.

## Now Let's Talk About Being an Entrepreneur (Inside a Big Company)

Nora Moebus, Head of Global Innovation at Nestlé, came in with energy that was honestly infectious.

Her main point: You can be an entrepreneur in a big company. Do what you like and what gives you energy.

Wait, what? You can be entrepreneurial in a corporate job?

Yes. Here's how:

- Entrepreneurs don't wait for instructions—they take initiative.
- You don't need to quit your job and start a company to be entrepreneurial. You just need to stop waiting for permission and start making things happen.

## Everyone Can Be Creative (Yes, Even You)

Nora said something that felt both obvious and revolutionary:

> Ask the right questions: What annoys you? What problems do you observe?

Innovation isn't about having a lightning bolt of genius. It's about paying attention to everyday problems and actually solving them.

The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity.

And here's the thing that should make you feel better: It's not about the idea, it's about execution.

Example: 7 people worldwide have the same idea every day. Gray and Bell literally patented the telephone on the same day.

Having the idea means nothing. Executing it means everything.

## Three Qualities That Actually Matter

Nora broke down what separates people who make things happen from people who just talk about making things happen:

1. **Ownership**  
   Care deeply. Go beyond your job description. Treat it like it's yours.
2. **Resilience**  
   How you show up matters more than your environment. Bad days happen. Show up anyway.
3. **Transforming People**  
   You can only transform a business by transforming people and behavior. Change starts with individuals.

## Some Final Wisdom from Nora

**On validation:**  
The most effective validation is making sure the problem is big enough to matter.

**On overcoming fear:**  
Go straight through it. She used this analogy: Buffalo run through storms instead of away from them—they get through faster that way.

**On asking better questions:**  
Read "The Innovators DNA." Keep asking "Why? Why? Why?" and "What if?"

**On neurodivergency:**  
Absolutely compatible with entrepreneurship. It's about how you think, not how you behave.

And her personal motto, which I love:

> "Everyone influences the energy in a room—bring positive energy to affect everyone positively."

## What I'm Taking Away from Day 2

Here's what's actually sticking with me:

- ✅ Technical + Business skills create powerful career combinations
- ✅ AI augments humans, doesn't replace them
- ✅ Collaboration beats individual effort for long-term success
- ✅ Ask better questions to drive innovation
- ✅ Protect your energy and work sustainably
- ✅ Take ownership and execute ideas, don't just generate them

Everyone has ideas. Winners execute.

## The Bottom Line

Day 2 was all about one central idea: The future isn't about choosing between human or machine. It's about being the human who knows how to work with machines.

Learn enough about technology to speak the language. Use AI to amplify what you're already good at. Ask better questions. Execute relentlessly. Protect your energy.

And maybe most importantly: You don't need permission to be innovative. You just need to start.
