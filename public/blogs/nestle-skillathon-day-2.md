# Day 2: AI Won't Steal Your Job (But Someone Using AI Might)

*The real talk about data, productivity, and why being human still matters*

**Read time: 5 minutes**

## Let's Address the Elephant in the Room

Everyone's freaking out about AI. "Will it take my job?" "Am I going to be obsolete?" "Should I panic?"

Mattia, one of Nestlé's leaders, cut through the noise with something simple:

**AI will enhance human roles, not replace them. The human touch remains essential.**

But here's the catch: You can't stick your head in the sand. Technology IS changing everything. You need to understand it, work WITH it, and use it to amplify what makes you uniquely human.

That's what Day 2 was about.

## What Actually Makes You Innovative?

Mattia broke down innovation into three things that work together:

**Curiosity & Rigor** - Ask questions, but actually follow through  
**Speed & Scale** - Moving fast is useless if you can't scale it  
**Pioneering Spirit with Discipline** - Be bold, but smart about it

Then he said something that hit me:

**"Challenge yourself at a young age to make things happen—this creates differentiation."**

Not "wait until you're senior." Not "learn everything first." Just start making things happen. Now.

The people who stand out? They're not necessarily the smartest. They're the ones who actually DO stuff.

## Inside Nestlé's Data World

Jessica Matheron, Nestlé's Chief Data Officer, showed us how a massive company actually handles data.

It's not sexy, but it's fascinating.

Her team does three things:

1. Make data reliable and accessible (boring but essential)
2. Keep it compliant and secure (even more boring, even more essential)
3. Turn it into insights people can actually use (this is where it gets interesting)

But my favorite quote from her should be on a poster:

**"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."**

Solo genius = quick wins  
Teams = lasting impact

## Three People, Three Different Data Careers

What surprised me was how different data jobs actually are:

### Mathieu: The Bridge Builder

He coordinates 100 stakeholders while managing budgets. His superpower? Having both technical skills AND business sense.

**Key insight:** You don't need to be the best coder OR the best businessperson. Being decent at BOTH makes you incredibly valuable.

### Tarik: The Foundation

He went from "shy technician" to confident professional by understanding that scale matters.

Building for one country vs. multiple countries? Completely different game.

His job—collecting, organizing, cleaning data—sounds boring. But without people like Tarik, nothing else works.

### Achille: The Future Builder

He's teaching AI to understand what you might want across ALL of Nestlé's products.

His vision: "Create consumer journey predictions similar to how LLMs predict next words."

Smart. And maybe a little creepy. But mostly smart.

## The Questions Everyone's Actually Asking

### "Do I need to learn to code?"

Not necessarily.

Learning basic tech helps you communicate better, but you don't need to build the thing. You just need to understand what's possible.

### "Will AI replace my intuition?"

No. Here's the truth:

- AI finds patterns humans might miss
- Humans ask the right questions
- Best results? Start with AI insights, add human judgment

**It's not AI OR humans. It's AI AND humans.**

### "Should I use AI for everything?"

NO.

They gave a perfect analogy: **"AI is like a hammer—understand your problem first, then use the tool."**

Don't throw AI at problems without knowing what you're actually trying to solve.

## Microsoft's Take: Productivity Is Broken

Carola from Microsoft told us we've been thinking about productivity all wrong.

**OLD WAY:**  
Do more, faster, measure everything

**NEW WAY:**  
Increase creativity, amplify impact, do what matters

Key insight: **Build WITH AI, not be replaced BY AI.**

## 10 Productivity Hacks That Actually Work

Here are the ones that stuck:

**1. The 2-Minute Rule**  
See a task? Do it immediately, schedule it, or delete it. Stop the mental pile-up.

**2. Eat Your Frog**  
Hardest task first thing every day. Everything else feels easier after.

**3. Batch Boring Stuff**  
Group repetitive tasks. Answer all emails at once. Your brain will thank you.

**4. Time Box It**  
"I'll work on this for 45 minutes" beats "I'll work until it's done."

**5. Parking Lot**  
Write down distracting ideas, review monthly. Don't let random thoughts derail you.

**6. Smart Delegate**  
Give ALL context upfront. Don't make people guess.

**7. Smart Inbox**  
Auto-sort emails. Keep inbox focused on what matters.

**8. Smart Invites**  
Multiple time slots, clear purpose, agenda. Respect people's time.

**9. Smart Prompts**  
Use AI for first drafts, then refine. Don't just copy-paste.

**10. Protect Your Energy**  
Not just your time. **Resting IS productivity.**

That last one? Huge. Your brain needs downtime to process and create.

## How to Actually Use AI Well

Most people are doing AI prompts wrong. Here's the formula:

1. **Goals** - What do you want?
2. **Context** - Who's it for? What tone?
3. **Sources** - Ground it in specifics
4. **Expectations** - Format, length, keywords

And most important: **Always review and revise.**

AI gives you a starting point, not a finished product.

## You Can Be an Entrepreneur (Without Quitting Your Job)

Nora Moebus, Head of Global Innovation, came in with infectious energy and one main point:

**You can be entrepreneurial in a big company. Do what gives you energy.**

Entrepreneurs don't wait for instructions—they take initiative.

You don't need to quit and start a company. You just need to stop waiting for permission.

---

## Everyone Can Be Creative (Yes, Even You)

Nora dropped this truth bomb:

**Ask the right questions: What annoys you? What problems do you see?**

Innovation isn't a lightning bolt of genius. It's paying attention to everyday problems and actually solving them.

The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity.

And here's what should make you feel better:

**It's not about the idea. It's about execution.**

Seven people worldwide have the same idea every day. Gray and Bell patented the telephone on the SAME DAY.

Ideas are cheap. Execution is everything.

## Three Qualities That Separate Doers from Talkers

**1. Ownership**  
Care deeply. Go beyond your job description. Treat it like it's yours.

**2. Resilience**  
How you show up matters more than your environment. Bad days happen. Show up anyway.

**3. Transforming People**  
You can only transform business by transforming people. Change starts with individuals.

## Wisdom That Stuck

**On fear:**  
"Buffalo run through storms instead of away from them—they get through faster."

Go straight through your fear.

**On questions:**  
Keep asking "Why? Why? Why?" and "What if?"

**On neurodivergency:**  
Absolutely compatible with entrepreneurship. It's about how you think, not how you behave.

**Her motto:**  
"Everyone influences the energy in a room—bring positive energy."

## What I'm Taking Away

**Technical + business skills = powerful combo**  
You don't need to master one. Being good at both makes you invaluable.

**AI augments, doesn't replace**  
Stop panicking. Start learning to work with it.

**Teams > solo genius**  
Go fast alone, go far together.

**Ask better questions**  
Stop waiting for inspiration. Start noticing problems.

**Rest is productive**  
Burnout isn't a badge of honor.

**Execute, don't just ideate**  
Everyone has ideas. Winners execute.

---

## The Bottom Line

The future isn't human OR machine. It's about being the human who knows how to work with machines.

Learn enough tech to speak the language. Use AI to amplify what you're good at. Ask better questions. Execute relentlessly. Protect your energy.

And most importantly: **You don't need permission to be innovative. You just need to start.**

*What hit you hardest? For me, it was "go fast alone, go far together." I've been trying to do everything solo. Time to change that.*
