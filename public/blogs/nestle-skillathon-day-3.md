# Day 3: The Power of YOU

*Job market reality, LinkedIn hacks, and why it's okay to not be okay*

**Read time: 5 minutes**

## 63% of Workers Aren't Ready for the Future

Brian McCabe from Adecco Group opened with a reality check:

Last year, only 11% of workers were "future ready." This year? 37%.

That's progress, but it also means **63% of us still aren't there.**

So what does "future ready" mean?

- Adaptable and flexible
- Open to change
- Tech-savvy
- Proactive about development

But here's the kicker: To be future ready NOW, you have to feel comfortable working alongside an AI agent. Not just using ChatGPT occasionally—actually collaborating with AI daily.

The good news? Future-ready workers aren't born. They're cultivated. You can become one.

---

## The AI Paradox

Here's where it gets weird:

Workers are optimistic. Three-quarters expect AI will create new jobs. 70% say it's already changed the skills they need.

Workers report saving **2 hours a day** thanks to AI. That's double last year.

But here's the problem: **This view is disconnected from reality.**

Workers FEEL more productive. Organizations aren't seeing the same gains.

Why? Only one-third of workers can confidently measure the impact of their work.

We're all using AI, feeling busy... but we don't actually know if what we're doing matters.

---

## What Would You Do With 2 Extra Hours?

If AI gave you back 2 hours every day, what would you do?

Brian's advice was clear:

- Focus on high-value impact
- Build trust in how jobs are redesigned
- Help your teams thrive

But workers need guidance. Without frameworks on what actually matters, we're just doing more stuff. Not necessarily the right stuff.

71% of employees now use AI as much as possible. But without direction, that's just noise.

---

## The Trust Gap

More than half of employees expect AI agents in their workflow next year.

But only a third of entry-level workers would welcome them.

Why? **Entry-level workers are scared.**

Leaders understand what AI can do. They know what tasks go to AI versus what stays human.

Junior workers? They just see a threat.

This tells us: **Communication and transparency are essential.**

---

## How to Work WITH AI (Not Against It)

Brian asked: How would you redesign your job together with AI?

Three steps:

1. **Collaborate on redesign** - Don't impose from the top
2. **Trust workers** - They know their jobs better than anyone
3. **Demonstrate how AI helps** - Make it concrete

And involve workers at every stage.

Brian's challenge: Find 2 hours a day. Dedicate it to learning about AI. Work smarter—it snowballs.

---

## The Questions Everyone's Asking

### "Isn't AI a shortcut? What about developing our minds?"

Brian's answer: **"AI is here. Get on the train or get left behind."**

But YOU decide what to pass to AI and what human work you want to keep.

### "Won't AI eliminate junior positions?"

Here's the messy truth: Companies are firing people, then hiring them back. The AI revolution is unpredictable.

Brian's take: AI will never replace humans. It will only augment them.

His advice? **Focus on skills, not job titles.**

The world is becoming skills-based. Future jobs might not exist yet.

## LinkedIn: Your Digital Business Card (That You're Probably Using Wrong)

Marcus Franlund from LinkedIn gave us a masterclass.

LinkedIn's numbers are staggering:

- 1.2 billion members
- 67 million companies
- 16 million jobs

Every minute:
- 90 members add a new role
- 17,000 connections are made
- 9,500 people apply for jobs

It's not the only platform you should use, but it's crucial.

---

## You Have a Brand Too

Marcus made a simple point most people miss:

**A brand is a company's promise. You have a brand too.**

Your brand is:
- What makes you unique
- What people should expect from you
- The standards you live up to

Your brand includes:
- **Who you are now** - Skills, experience, network
- **What you want** - Values, goals, ambitions

Four parts of your brand message:

1. Passion - What you care about
2. Goals - Where you're headed
3. Skills - What you're good at
4. Credibility - Proof you deliver

---

## The Power of Networking

LinkedIn structure:
- 1st degree: Your direct connections
- 2nd degree: Connections of your connections
- 3rd degree: Next level out

**50% of hires come from personal connections.**

If you want to work somewhere and don't know anyone there, check if someone in your network does. Ask for a warm introduction.

That's leverage.

Marcus's advice: Don't chase numbers. Build genuine relationships.

---

## Creating Content

Should you post on LinkedIn?

Marcus's answer: **Posts with emotion get the most interaction.**

Don't just say "I spoke at an event."

Say how you felt nervous, how standing on stage felt, what it meant to you.

Be personal. Be emotional. That's what gets engagement.

Other tips:
- Join groups about topics you care about
- Start conversations
- Include rich media
- Follow interesting companies

---

## Mental Health: The Real Conversation

Dean Coulson came in for the final session, and honestly? Most important part of the day.

His opening: **"Our brains aren't wired for the modern world. It's too fast-paced."**

We're told we always have to be happy. But it's important to know how you feel NOW to know where you want to go next.

**It's okay to not be okay.**

Then make a choice about what you do next.

Dean works with CEOs. Guess what? They struggle too. We're all human. We all feel it.

---

## Awareness and Choice

Have awareness: Where am I right now?

Then choose: React like you always do? Or pause, slow down, choose differently?

Dean showed us a scale:

- Struggling (1)
- Languishing (5) - "I'm fine, I'm okay"
- Flourishing (10)

Traditional psychology takes you from 1 to 5. That's not wrong—it's just not enough.

Instead of "I'll be happy when..." think **"How can I be happy now?"**

---

## The PERMAH Model

This framework changed how I think about wellbeing:

**P - Positive Emotions**  
Cultivate positivity daily.

**E - Engagement**  
Being in the zone. Time passes without noticing.

**R - Relationships**  
Connections, family, gratitude, kindness. We're hardwired for social groups.

**M - Meaning**  
Purpose, impact. Like volunteering or helping others.

**A - Accomplishment**  
Things achieved and goals ahead. Remind yourself of 3 things daily.

**H - Health**  
Sleep, recovery, calm time.

Dean had us rate ourselves 1-10 in each area.

Then: **The Plus One Principle.**

If you're at 1, how do you get to 2? If you're at 2, how do you get to 3?

Small, incremental progress.

---

## Why Your Brain Works Against You

When stressed or threatened, your brain downregulates the thinking part. It's too slow.

**Physiology trumps psychology 100% of the time.**

In those moments, you're literally out of your mind.

We spend two-thirds of our time in the reactive part of our brains.

That's why we say things we regret. That's why we make bad decisions.

---

## The Negativity Bias

Why do we focus on negative things? **To keep us safe.**

When 5 things go great and 1 goes wrong, you focus on the wrong thing.

But we can change this through **neuroplasticity**—growing new neural pathways.

Dean's analogy: Walking through a wheat field. First time is hard. Walk the same path daily, it gets easier.

New habits work the same way.

---

## Two Tools to Change Your Mind

### 1. Check In Daily

Ask yourself: Where's my energy, mood, motivation today?

Score yourself 1-10.

3 or 4? Don't overcommit. That's okay.

8, 9, or 10? Energy is high. Bring it on.

If you check in for 7 days and numbers are consistently low, talk to someone.

### 2. Practice Gratitude

Write down 3 things you're grateful for each day.

Be specific. Not just "my family" but "I'm grateful my mom made Sunday lunch."

When you get specific, you relive that positive experience.

Practice for 21 days. You'll start seeing the world differently.

Dean's never seen someone do this without seeing change.

---

## Mindfulness: Doing Nothing

How often do we stop doing anything? Almost never.

Our minds stay active. Doing nothing feels uncomfortable.

How often do we tune into sounds outside? Rarely. We're on our phones or listening to music.

That's not mindfulness. It's about slowing down.

---

## The 10-Finger Gratitude Exercise

Dean walked us through 10 prompts. Eyes closed, counting on fingers:

1. Someone you're grateful for
2. Someone in your family
3. A friend
4. A group you're part of
5. Something you have
6. Something you can do
7. Something you're looking forward to
8. Something you've achieved
9. A place you've been
10. Something you've enjoyed eating

Just a few minutes. We slowed down and focused on gratitude and being present.

**Challenge: Pick one tool. Practice for 21 days.**

---

## Real Questions, Real Answers

**On impostor syndrome:**  
It's uncomfortable. It's okay. It happens when doing something new.

**On staying calm when overwhelmed:**  
Practice breathing. Belly breathing. Box breathing. It helps you think rationally.

**On Gen Z and mental health:**  
We're more connected than ever but feel we need to keep up with everyone.

Dean's advice: Use tools. Slow down. Mindfulness puts us in rational brains more often.

**On stress:**  
Stress is inevitable. Not bad. Chronic stress is the problem.

Build in timeouts. Recovery time matters.

**On negativity spirals:**  
Awareness is key. Recognize when you're reactive.

Don't say "I AM anxious." Say "I FEEL anxious."

Emotions ride on waves.

Simple things done consistently make the biggest difference.

---

## What I'm Taking Away

**The future belongs to people who work WITH AI**  
Get comfortable or get left behind.

**Your LinkedIn is your professional brand**  
Most people do it wrong. Fix that.

**Skills matter more than job titles**  
The economy is changing. Adapt.

**It's okay to not be okay**  
Check in. Practice gratitude. Be mindful.

**Small actions create big changes**  
Plus One Principle. Neuroplasticity. 21-day challenges.

**Protect your mental health**  
Without wellbeing, nothing else matters.

---

## The Bottom Line

Day 3 was about getting real.

Real about AI's impact. Real about positioning yourself in the job market. Real about the fact that you can't build a meaningful career if you're burned out and disconnected.

Future-ready workers aren't just tech-savvy. They're self-aware. They take care of themselves. They know when to push and when to rest.

**The power of YOU isn't about being perfect. It's about being intentional.**
