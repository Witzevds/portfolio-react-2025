# Day 3: The Power of YOU (And Why Your Mental Health Matters More Than Your LinkedIn)

_Job market reality checks, LinkedIn mastery, and learning that it's okay to not be okay_

## Let's Talk About Your Future (And Why 63% of Workers Aren't Ready for It)

Brian McCabe from Adecco Group dropped a stat that made everyone sit up: Last year, only 11% of workers were "future ready." This year? 37%.

That's... progress? But also means 63% of us still aren't there yet.

So what does "future ready" even mean? According to their research, it's workers who are:
- Adaptable and flexible
- Open to change
- Tech-savvy
- Proactive about their development

But here's what changed this year that I found fascinating: To qualify as future ready now, you have to feel comfortable working alongside an AI agent. Not just using ChatGPT occasionally—actually collaborating with AI as part of your daily workflow.

The model isn't just descriptive, it's actionable. Future-ready workers aren't born—they're cultivated. You can become one, even if you're not there today.

## The AI Paradox: Workers Are Optimistic, Reality Is... Complicated

Here's where things get interesting. Three-quarters of workers expect AI will create new jobs. 70% say it's already changed the skills they need in their roles.

And get this: there's real optimism from workers about AI. This is contrary to what we're seeing in the media right now, and the data is fresh.

Workers are saving an average of 2 hours a day thanks to AI. That's double last year's figure.

But here's the catch: This view is disconnected from the gains employers are seeing in reality.

Workers FEEL like they're being more productive. Organizations aren't seeing those same gains. Something's not adding up.

Why? Brian's answer was eye-opening: Only one-third of workers can confidently measure the impact of their work.

So we're all using AI, feeling busy, feeling productive... but we don't actually know if what we're doing matters.

## What Would You Do With 2 Extra Hours a Day?

Seriously, think about it. If AI gave you back 2 hours every day, what would you do with them?

The call to action from Brian was clear:
- Focus on high-value impact
- Build trust in job redesign
- Purpose drives progress—help your teams thrive in the AI era

But workers need guidance. They need frameworks. They need leadership telling them how to channel all the benefits from AI into impactful work.

71% of employees now use AI as much as possible—that's up 19% since 2024. But without guidance on what actually matters, we're just... doing more stuff. Not necessarily the right stuff.

## The Trust Gap: AI Agents Are Coming (Whether You're Ready or Not)

More than half of employees expect AI agents to be part of their workflow in the next year.

But—and this is huge—only a third of entry-level workers would welcome them.

Why? Leaders are significantly more likely to be comfortable with AI agents because they have a deeper understanding of the potential impact on jobs. They understand what goes to the AI agent versus what stays with humans.

Entry-level workers? They're scared. And honestly, who can blame them?

This tells us that communication and transparency are essential for building trust right now.

## How to Redesign Your Job (With AI, Not Against It)

Brian asked a question worth reflecting on: How would you redesign your job together with AI?

Building trust is foundational to any successful job redesign. Three practical steps:
1. Collaborate with workers on job redesign - Don't impose it from the top
2. Trust workers to deliver on the vision - They know their jobs better than anyone
3. Demonstrate how AI will enhance future careers - Make it concrete, not abstract

And here's the important part: Involve workers at every stage. They're the experts in their jobs.

Brian's challenge: Find 2 hours a day. Dedicate it to learning and upskilling around AI. Always work more efficiently—it's a snowball effect.

## The Questions Everyone's Actually Asking

"Isn't this pushing us to rely on AI too much? It's a shortcut. What about developing our analytical minds?"

Brian's answer was refreshingly straightforward:

"Look, AI is here. It's top of mind. You either get on the train or you might get left behind."

But—and this is important—you define for yourself what makes sense to pass to AI and what human-only, creative, wonderful work you want to keep.

AI is a tool. Use it strategically.

"Won't AI reduce junior positions? How can new graduates enter the job market?"

Here's what's actually happening: Companies are firing employees, then hiring them back. The AI revolution is messy and unpredictable.

Brian's opinion (and I agree): AI will never replace humans. It will only augment them. There's no future in work without humans and AI working hand in hand.

His advice? Focus on skills, not job titles.

The world is becoming a skills-based economy. Future jobs might not even exist yet. (Remember when everyone thought the metaverse would be the future? Or that prompt engineering would be a career?)

Look for skills that are going to be important in this new world and channel your personal time and development into those.

## LinkedIn: Your Digital Business Card (That Most People Are Using Wrong)

Marcus Franlund from LinkedIn gave us a masterclass, and honestly, even if you think you know LinkedIn, there were nuggets here worth paying attention to.

LinkedIn's vision: Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.

The numbers are staggering:
- 1.2 billion+ members
- 67 million+ companies
- 16 million+ jobs
- 42,000+ skills tracked
- 141,000+ schools

Every minute on LinkedIn:
- 90 members add a new role to their profile
- 17,000+ network connections are made
- 9,500+ members apply for jobs
- 138 hours of LinkedIn Learning content are watched

It's not the only platform you should use, but it's a crucial stepping stone to new opportunities.

## Your Brand Isn't Just for Companies

Marcus made a point that's obvious once you hear it but most people never think about:

A brand is a company's promise to its customers. You have a brand too.

Your brand is:
- What makes you unique
- What people should expect from you
- The standards you want to live up to

The value of your brand: Why would someone choose you? What makes you stand out?

Your brand includes:
- Who you are now - Skills, school, work experience, network, areas of expertise
- What you want in the future - Values, goals, ambitions

Marcus broke down your brand message into four parts:
1. Passion - What you care about
2. Goals - Where you're headed
3. Being good at - Your skills
4. Credibility - Proof you can deliver

## The 10 Steps to a Best-in-Class LinkedIn Profile

Marcus walked us through this systematically. I'm going to hit the highlights:

1. **Add a Photo**
   - Fresh, high-res, good lighting, just you. No pets, no people in the background. Doesn't need to be professional—just needs to represent who you are right now.
   - The impact: 9x more connection requests, 21x more profile views, 36x more messages
2. **Record Your Name**
   - 10-second audio clip so people know how to pronounce your name. Update on mobile. Hold phone 4 inches away.
3. **Create Your Profile Video**
   - 30-second intro. Share your story. Highlight goals. Be yourself.
4. **Add Your Industry**
   - Members with industry information receive up to 9x more profile views. Over 300,000 people search by industry on LinkedIn every week.
5. **Draft a Compelling Summary**
   - This is your elevator pitch. Focus on career accomplishments and aspirations. 40+ words minimum. Check spelling and use paragraphs.
6. **Feature Content**
   - Pin rich media you're proud of. Articles, presentations, projects—bring your story to life.
7. **Detail Your Work Experience**
   - Members with up-to-date positions receive: 5x more connection requests, 8x more profile views, 10x more messages
   - Even if it's a simple job, talk about what you learned. Worked in a cafe? That's client relationships, sales, customer service. Frame it right.
   - Pro tip: 5 sentences max per job. Use text, no bullet points.
8. **Add Career Breaks**
   - Don't hide them. Add the break type and details. Highlight new experiences or skills learned. 51% of hiring managers are more likely to contact you if you're transparent about career breaks.
9. **Add Volunteer Experience**
   - Members who add volunteer experience get up to 6x more profile views than those without.
10. **Add Skills & Get Endorsed**
    - Members who add 5 or more skills receive up to 17x more profile views.
    - Marcus's advice on skills was smart: Think of them as keywords. You're not saying you're an expert—you're saying you're interested and actively working on it. If you're developing AI literacy right now, add it. It helps you show up for the right opportunities.
    - Add up to 50 skills. Get endorsed by colleagues.

**Bonus: Request Recommendations**
Recommendations build credibility and validate your skills. Don't be shy about asking.

## The Power of Networking (And How LinkedIn Actually Works)

Here's the structure:
- 1st degree - All your direct connections
- 2nd degree - All the connections of your connections
- 3rd degree - Connections of your 2nd-degree connections

50% of hires result from a personal connection (first-degree).

But here's the genius part: If you have 200 connections and want to work at a company where you don't know anyone directly, you can see if someone in your network has connections there. Then you ask for a warm introduction.

That's leverage.

Marcus's advice: Don't chase numbers. Keep your network valid. If you meet someone or have a conversation, connect with them. Build genuine relationships.

## Show You're Open to Work

Add job-seeking preferences. You're 40% more likely to be noticed by recruiters.

## Creating Content on LinkedIn

People always ask: Should I post on LinkedIn?

Marcus's answer, backed by LinkedIn's editorial team data: Posts with emotion get the most interaction.

Don't just say "I spoke at an event today." Say how you felt nervous beforehand, how it felt standing on stage, what the experience meant to you.

The more personal and emotional you are, the more engagement you get.

Share your authentic voice. Don't let AI do it all.

Other tips:
- Be active in groups around topics that matter to you
- Start conversations
- Include rich media
- Follow companies you're interested in

## Most In-Demand Skills for 2025

Marcus gave us the list. Pay attention:
1. AI literacy
2. Strategic thinking
3. Communication
4. Adaptability
5. Client & stakeholder management

Notice what's NOT on that list? Super technical coding skills. It's all about thinking, adapting, and communicating.

## LinkedIn Pro Tips

Most underrated feature? LinkedIn Learning. Keep learning.

Should you get Premium? Nah. Basic is good enough for most people.

Biggest mistake people make? Lying. It's so easy to look things up. Don't do it.

## Mental Health: The Conversation We Actually Need

Dean Coulson, an executive coach and wellbeing expert, came in for the final session and honestly? This might have been the most important part of the day.

His opening line: "Our brains are not wired for the modern world. It's too fast-paced."

When our moods dip, it's about understanding what happens and what the consequences are. We're told we always have to be happy, but it's important to know how you feel and where you are now to know where you want to go next.

It's okay to not be okay.

Then make a choice about what you do next.

Dean works with CEOs and business leaders, and guess what? They struggle with this too. We're all human. We all feel it. We just think we're the only person, so we don't share it.

## The Awareness-Choice Framework

Have the awareness to say: Where am I right now?

Then in that moment, make a choice. Do you react the way you always react? Or do you pause, slow down, and choose a different response?

Dean showed us a diagram:
- Struggling (left)
- Languishing (middle) - "I'm fine, I'm okay"
- Flourishing (right)

Traditional psychology takes you from struggling (1) to languishing (5). That's not wrong—it's just not enough.

Instead of thinking "I'll be happy when..." we have to think "How can I be happy now?"

## What Is Happiness?

Dean asked: Is happiness a feeling or something you do? What does it mean?

For him, happiness is a state of joy. Something you enjoy doing—photography, nature, being peaceful.

For me... I'll fill that in later. But it made me think.

## The PERMAH Model

This framework changed how I think about wellbeing:

- **P** - Positive Emotions: Cultivate positivity in your daily life.
- **E** - Engagement: Being in the zone. Doing something that keeps you in the moment so time passes without you noticing.
- **R** - Relationships: Connections, family, gratitude, kindness. Humans are hardwired to be in social groups.
- **M** - Meaning: Purpose, impact, something we believe in. Like volunteering or impacting someone else's life. (This means a lot to me personally.)
- **A** - Accomplishment: Things we've achieved and want to achieve. Remind yourself of 3 things every day—small or big, doesn't matter. Sometimes we forget about the things we already did.
- **H** - Health: Sleep, recovery, recharge. Do you give yourself time to be calm?

Dean had us do a PERMAH wheel exercise—rate yourself 1-10 in each area. Where are you now?

Then: The Plus One Principle. If I have a 1, how can I get to a 2? If I have a 2, how can I get to a 3? Small, incremental progress.

## Why Your Brain Works Against You (And What to Do About It)

When you're stressed or feel threatened, your brain downregulates the thinking part of your brain. It's too slow. It wants to react and do what you did last time.

Physiology trumps psychology 100% of the time.

In those moments, you're literally out of your mind. It's very hard to focus.

As humans in the modern world, we spend two-thirds of our time in the reactive part of our brains.

That's why we say things we didn't mean. That's why we make decisions we regret.

## The Negativity Bias

Why do people always see things through a negative lens? To keep us safe.

When 5 things go great and 1 thing goes wrong, you focus on the thing that didn't go great.

But we can change this through neuroplasticity—reorganizing and growing new neural pathways.

Dean used a wheat field analogy: The first time you walk through it, it's hard. But if you walk the same path every day, it gets easier. Eventually, it's just something you do.

New habits work the same way. It takes effort at first, but the more you practice, the more natural it becomes.

## The Happiness Hormones

- **Serotonin** - Sleep and sunlight are important for this
- **Endorphins** - Give you brief euphoria and mask pain
- **Dopamine** - The reward chemical
- **Oxytocin** - The connection chemical

Exercise hits all 4 happy hormones.

## Two Tools to Cultivate a Positive Mind

1. **Check In**
   - Ask yourself daily: Where's my energy, mood, and motivation today?
   - Score yourself 1-10.
   - If you're a 3 or 4: You don't have the energy to take on the world. Do what you need to do, but don't overcommit. And that's okay.
   - If you're an 8, 9, or 10: Your mood is good, energy is high, motivation is there. Bring it on.
   - If you check in for 7 days and your numbers are consistently low, that's when you know you need to talk to somebody—a friend, a professional, someone.
2. **Practicing Gratitude**
   - This sounds simple, but it's one of the most potent techniques to rewire how you view the world.
   - Write down 3 things you're grateful for each day.
   - Doesn't matter how big or small. The more detailed, the better.
   - Not just "my family"—but "I'm grateful to my mom because she made me Sunday lunch."
   - When you get specific, you relive that positive experience. Same hormone cascade. Same happiness. Same smile.
   - If you practice this for 21 days, you will start seeing the world differently.
   - Dean said he's never worked with anyone who's done this who hasn't seen some kind of change.

## Mindfulness: The Art of Doing Nothing

How often do we stop doing anything? Almost never.

Our mind keeps being active, but doing nothing feels uncomfortable at first.

How often do we tune into the sounds around us outside? Highly unlikely—we're listening to music or on our phone.

That's not mindfulness. It's about slowing down.

## The 10-Finger Gratitude Exercise

Dean walked us through this live, and honestly? It gave me real peace.

He gave us 10 prompts. We closed our eyes and counted on our fingers:
1. Someone you're grateful for at work or in your life
2. Someone in your family
3. A friend
4. A group you're part of
5. Something you have
6. Something you're able to do
7. Something you're looking forward to
8. Something you've achieved
9. A place you've been to
10. Something you've enjoyed eating

Just a few minutes. We slowed everything down and focused on gratitude and mindfulness, being in the present moment.

Challenge: Select one tool to practice over the next 21 days.

## Q&A: The Real Questions

**On Impostor Syndrome**
It's an uncomfortable emotion. It's okay to feel it. It happens when we're doing something we haven't done yet—it's a step into the unknown.

(I feel this a lot too, honestly.)

**On Staying Calm When Overwhelmed**
Practice breathing. Belly breathing. Diaphragmatic breathing. Box breathing. It helps you see things in a more rational way.

**On Gen Z and Mental Wellbeing**
We're more connected than ever before, but we feel like we need to keep up with everybody.

(I deleted my social media outside LinkedIn about a year ago, and it really is a weight off my shoulders.)

Dean's advice: It sounds counterintuitive because of FOMO (fear of missing out), but nothing's going to change without us being there.

Use the tools. Slow things down. Mindfulness puts us in our thinking, rational brains more often.

If we can get into that calm nervous system more, we'll have more sense of self-esteem and assuredness.

**On Living With Stress**
Stress is inevitable. It's not a bad thing. It's when we feel stressed for a long period (chronic stress) that it negatively impacts our health.

Have timeouts. Build in recovery time.

**On Stopping the Negativity Spiral**
It comes down to awareness. The more you practice awareness, the more you see when things start to happen.

We all have a choice, even if it feels like we don't.

Recognize when you're in that reactive space. Observe what's happening instead of thinking "I AM anxious." Say "I FEEL anxious." It's completely different.

Emotions ride on a wave.

Don't allow yourself to get to the bottom of the spiral. Recognize your trigger. What's your go-to that will take you away from that?

Simple things done consistently make the biggest difference.

## What I'm Taking Away from Day 3

- ✅ The future belongs to people who work WITH AI, not against it
- ✅ Your LinkedIn profile is your professional brand
- ✅ Skills matter more than job titles
- ✅ It's okay to not be okay
- ✅ Small, consistent actions create big changes
- ✅ Protect your mental health as fiercely as you protect your career

Without wellbeing, nothing else matters.

## The Bottom Line

Day 3 was about getting real. Real about AI's impact on work. Real about how to position yourself in a changing job market. And most importantly, real about the fact that you can't build a meaningful career if you're burned out, anxious, and disconnected from what actually matters.

Future-ready workers aren't just tech-savvy and adaptable. They're self-aware. They take care of themselves. They know when to push and when to rest.

The power of YOU isn't about being perfect. It's about being intentional.

Which tool are you going to practice for the next 21 days? For me, it's the gratitude practice. I need that reminder to see the positive.
